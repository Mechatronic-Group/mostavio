> MOSTAVIO has successfully completed over 1,000 subscale flight tests, a major milestone in the validation of its flight control system and autonomous capabilities. These tests provide critical data for sensor fusion, stability control, and flight controller integration, allowing the engineering team to refine system parameters and optimize performance for full-scale eVTOL applications. 

MOSTAVIO has achieved a major technical milestone by surpassing 1,000 successful subscale drone flight tests, reinforcing the companyâ€™s efforts to refine flight controller integration, sensor fusion algorithms, and autonomous flight capabilities for its eVTOL platform. 

Each flight test provides high-resolution telemetry data that allows engineers to assess system dynamics, aerodynamics, and onboard decision-making processes. By systematically testing various configurations, the team has optimized control loops, sensor fusion strategies, and fault tolerance mechanisms to enhance stability and maneuverability. 

The subscale testing program has been instrumental in validating the hardware-software interaction between the flight controller, inertial measurement unit (IMU), GPS, and onboard computing system. These tests ensure seamless real-time adjustments in flight parameters, enhancing the overall autonomy of the eVTOL system.

With over 1,000 flights completed, MOSTAVIO is now positioned to transition from subscale validation to full-scale autonomous flight trials. The insights gained from these tests will drive further advancements in waypoint navigation, redundancy management, and real-time obstacle avoidance, bringing the company closer to deploying a fully autonomous eVTOL system.
