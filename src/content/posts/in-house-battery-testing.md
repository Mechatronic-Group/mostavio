> MOSTAVIO is vertically integrating its battery testing and pack development capabilities to enhance the performance and safety of its eVTOL propulsion systems. The team has developed a specialized battery testing jig for individual cell evaluation, alongside an in-house battery management system (BMS), custom pack assembly, and thermal management solutions. This approach ensures complete control over battery reliability, efficiency, and integration into eVTOL platforms.

MOSTAVIO is advancing its battery testing and pack development capabilities by vertically integrating critical processes to ensure the highest standards of reliability and performance for eVTOL applications. With an emphasis on in-house development, the team has designed a dedicated battery testing jig to evaluate individual cells before assembling them into high-performance battery packs. 

The custom-built test jig allows engineers to analyze key parameters, including capacity, internal resistance, thermal behavior, and cycle life, ensuring only the most robust cells are selected for integration. Following rigorous testing, the team assembles battery packs internally, incorporating a custom-designed Battery Management System (BMS), precision balancing circuits, and advanced thermal regulation methods to optimize efficiency and longevity. 

The company will continue refining its battery testing protocols, pack architecture, and safety systems to push the limits of energy storage for next-generation air mobility.
