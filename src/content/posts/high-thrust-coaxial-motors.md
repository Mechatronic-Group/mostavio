MOSTAVIO has engineered a thrust stand for very large motors and propellers, designed to advance the performance evaluation of brushless motor propulsion systems. This test jig, capable of handling over 150 kg (1500N) of thrust, integrates a load cell-based thrust measurement system, providing precise readings alongside RPM, voltage, and current monitoring. 

The development of this high-thrust testing jig marks a significant step in Mostavio’s ongoing efforts to refine eVTOL propulsion efficiency. By systematically testing various motor-propeller configurations, the company aims to optimize motor-to-motor spacing and enhance overall performance. 

“This testing capability is essential to our mission of developing highly efficient and reliable eVTOL propulsion systems,” said Nima Pourmostaghini, CEO at Mostavio. “By leveraging real-world data from our thrust stand, we can make informed design decisions that push the boundaries of urban air mobility.”
